# ACE-SevsCe-Improvments
This addon is designed to improve those aspects that fell victim to balance in ACE. Also new content that should diversify your vehicles or make it more advanced.

# Improvments
At the moment, ACE itself has many different guns, engines, and materials for armor, but we decided to supplement them and rebalance some characteristics to older versions of ACE.
1. New materials for your vehicles: concrete, wood, armored-glass.
2. New engines and their types: hybrid and 1800hp and more.
3. Slightly changed balance.
4. New guns, machine guns, rotary autocannons and more.
